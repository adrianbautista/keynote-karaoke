# Keynote Karaoke

Keynote Karaoke is a presentation game that helps players develop public speaking and improvisation skills.  

Every presentation round starts with a random prompt and four randomly selected images. The presenting player must then develop a keynote based on the prompt and the images.  

The [original version](https://github.com/adrianbautista/keynote-karaoke/tree/v1.0) of Keynote Karaoke was built within 24 hours for the General Assembly DevFest internal hackathon.  

Major kudos to Andre Plaut and Anuraag Verma for introducing me to the original Keynote Karaoke game.
